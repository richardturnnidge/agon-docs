# Programming your Agon Light computer

Whilst there is a lot of great software you can download and run on your Agon, you can write your own software too. And this is probably the reason you bought your Agon!

There are several programming languages available, something for everyone, from beginner to expert... or those just reliving their 1980's memories.

Some of the languages run directly on your Agon computer. Some run on your Windows, Mac or Linux PC for transfer to your Agon. Plus, there are some which your can run both on the Agon and your PC.

Most of the languages available allow you to code in traditional 16bit or 24bit _ADL mode_.

In order to help speed up development, there is also an emulator so your can program and test _most_ code quickly on your PC, before transferring to the Agon.



## Languages

### Basic

The most popular language is instaled by many Agon owners and is a great way to quickly start programming your Agon computer. 

The Agon port of BBC Basic provides a familiar yet powerful language used by beginners and experts alike. It runs directly on the Agon computer and is often started automaticaly by many users with a command in the `autoexec.txt` file.


### Z80 Assembly

If you have ever writen software in z80 Assembly for the Sinclair ZX81, ZX Spectrum, MSX, Amstrad CPC, TRS-80, Nintendo Game Boy, or even the Texas Instruments calulators, then this will be familliar territory for you.

You can write your code in whatever text editor you like, then assmble your source code with `ez80asm`, a z80 assembler which runs on the Agon itself, or on Mac, Windows, Linux, and even Raspberry Pi.


### C++

Many programmers enjoy coding in `C` or `C++`. This language is also available and there are a few options for coding on your desktop PC, then compiing and transferring onto your Agon to run.




### B Simple

_B_ was a language which, unsurpisingly, was around before _C_. This interpretation, `B Simple`, allows you to create programs that will be familliar to anyone who has used C, but without all the advance features of C++. B Simple can be used on the Agon itslef, or on your desktop PC under Mac, Linux, Windows or Raspberry Pi. 

`B Simple`'s approach is to compile your code into z80 assembler, then use the power of `ez80asm` to assemble the compiled code into the final binary executable.

### Forth

Some Agon users might reminis on the days long gone of owning (or wishing they owned) a Jupiter Ace, with its Forth programming language. 

Agon Forth runs on the Agon itself and provides a great way to learn the language.
